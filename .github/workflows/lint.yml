          #  exist or not doesn't matter). But the good thing is that the annotations
          #  will still show up. I think this can be useful if we don't want the pipeline
          #  to stop just because we had some linter errors.

          #  bit gimmicky, as it passes the linter check despite having new linter errors
          #  in some cases. So we opt in for all annotations of linter errors to show up,
          #  this is actually nicer because we suppress our linter errors manually
          #  anyways so there shouldn't be any linter errors anyways. The enforces us to
          #  always have a clean lint state.
