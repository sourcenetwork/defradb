		Long: `Delete relationship

To revoke access to a document for an actor, we must delete the relationship between the
actor and the document. In order to delete the relationship we require all of the following:

1) Target DocID: The docID of the document we want to delete a relationship for.
2) Collection Name: The name of the collection that has the Target DocID.
3) Relation Name: The type of relation (name must be defined within the linked policy on collection).
4) Target Identity: The identity of the actor the relationship is being deleted for.
5) Requesting Identity: The identity of the actor that is making the request.

Notes:
  - ACP must be available (i.e. ACP can not be disabled).
  - The target document must be registered with ACP already (policy & resource specified).
  - The requesting identity MUST either be the owner OR the manager (manages the relation) of the resource.
  - If the relationship record was not found, then it will be a no-op.
  - Learn more about [ACP & DPI Rules](/acp/README.md)

Example: Let another actor (4d092126012ebaf56161716018a71630d99443d9d5217e9d8502bb5c5456f2c5) read a private document:
