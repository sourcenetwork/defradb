// This test was added during https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb/issues/2924
// The issue was that [multiScanNode] that keeps track of how many calls to [Next()] should
// be made, would call [Init()] and [Start()] every time without tracking, which would result
// in child nodes being initialized and started multiple times, which in turn created
// index iterators without closing them.
