# Database API

So far, all the queries and mutations that have been discussed were specific to the stored and managed developer or user-created objects. However, that is only one aspect of DefraDB's GraphQL API. The other part of DefraDB GraphQL API is the auxiliary APIs, which include MerkleCRDT Traversal, Schema Management, and more.

## MerkleCRDTs

All objects in DefraDB are stored in MerkleCRDTs (see [Merkle CRDT Guide](../../guides/merkle-crdt.md)). These MerkleCRDTs are represented as a series of small updates connected in a MerkleDAG. The MerkleDAG is a Merklized version of a DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph), which means that each node in the DAG references a parent node through some kind of Content Identifier (CID).

The image below shows an example structure of a MerkleDAG.

The `Head` CID represents the "current" or "latest" state of a MerkleDAG.

DefraDB allows you to query, traverse, and validate the DAG structure, allowing for self-verifying data structures. 

In DefraDB Database API, DAG nodes are represented as `Commit`, `CommitLink`, and `Delta` types. They are defined as shown below:

```graphql
# Commit is an individual node in a CRDTs MerkleDAG
type Commit {
    cid: String            // cid is the Content Identifier of this commit
    height: Int            // height is the incremental version of the current commit
    delta: Delta           // delta is the delta-state update generated by a CRDT mutation 
    previous: [Commit]     // previous is the links to the previous node in the MerkleDAG
    links: [CommitLink]    // links are any additional commits this commit may reference.
}

# CommitLink is a named link to a commit
type CommitLink {
    name: String           // name is the name of the CommitLink
    commit: Commit        // commit is the linked commit
}

# Delta is the differential state change from one node to another
type Delta {
    payload: String      // payload is a base64 encoded byte-array.
}
```

To query the latest commit of an object (with id: '123'):
```graphql
query {
    latestCommits(docid: "123") {
        cid
        height
        delta {
            payload
        }
    }
}
```

To query all the commits of an object (with id: '123'):
```graphql
query {
    allCommits(docid: "123") {
        cid
        height
        delta {
            payload
        }
    }
}
```

To query a specific commit:
```graphql 
query {
    Commits(cid: 'Qm123') {
        cid
        height
        delta {
            payload
        }
    }
}
```

In addition to using `Commits` specific queries, include commit version sub-fields in object queries.

```graphql 
query {
    User {
        _docID
        name
        age
        
        _version {
            cid
            height
        }
    }
}
```

The above example shows how to query for the additional `_version` field that is generated automatically for each added schema type. The `_version` has the same execution as `latestCommits`.

Both `_version` and `latestCommits` return an array of `Commits` types because the `HEAD` of the MerkleDAG can point to more than one DAG node. This is caused by two concurrent updates to the DAG at the same height. The DAG usually has a single head. However, it can also have multiple heads.

Commits queries also work with aggregates, grouping, limit, offset, order, dockey, cid, and depth
There is __typename introspection keyword that works on all queries that does not appear to be documented anywhere, for example:

```graphql 
commits(dockey: "bae-d4303725-7db9-53d2-b324-f3ee44020e52") {
    cid
    __typename
}
```
