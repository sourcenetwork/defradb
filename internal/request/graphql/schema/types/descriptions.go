	OrderArgDescription string = `
An optional set of field-orders which may be used to sort the results. An
 empty set will be ignored.
`
	GroupByArgDescription string = `
An optional set of fields for which to group the contents of this field by.
 If this argument is provided, only fields used to group may be rendered in
 the immediate child selector.  Additional fields may be selected by using
 the '_group' selector within the immediate child selector. If an empty set
 is provided, the restrictions mentioned still apply, although all results
 will appear within the same group.
`
	LimitArgDescription string = `
An optional value that caps the number of results to the number provided.
 A limit of zero will be ignored.
`
	OffsetArgDescription string = `
An optional value that skips the given number of results that would have
 otherwise been returned.  Commonly used alongside the 'limit' argument,
 this argument will still work on its own.
`
	commitDescription string = `
Commit represents an individual commit to a MerkleCRDT, every mutation to a
 document will result in a new commit per modified field, and one composite
 commit composed of the field level commits and, in the case of an update,
 the prior composite commit.  If the collection is branchable, there will
 also be a collection-level commit for each mutation.
`
	commitDocIDArgDescription string = `
An optional docID parameter for this commit query. Only commits for a document
 with a matching docID will be returned.  If no documents match, the result
 set will be empty.
`
	commitFieldIDArgDescription string = `
An optional field ID parameter for this commit query. Only commits for a fields
 matching this ID will be returned. Specifying 'C' will limit the results to 
 composite (document level) commits only, otherwise field IDs are numeric. If no
 fields match, the result set will be empty.
`
	commitCIDArgDescription string = `
An optional value that specifies the commit ID of the commits to return. If a
 matching commit is not found then an empty set will be returned.
`
	commitDepthArgDescription string = `
An optional value that specifies the maximum depth to which the commit DAG graph
 should be traversed from matching commits.
`
	commitLinksDescription string = `
Child commits in the DAG that contribute to the composition of this commit.
 Composite commits will link to the field commits for the fields modified during
 the single mutation.  Collection commits will link to composites.
`
	commitHeightFieldDescription string = `
Height represents the location of the commit in the DAG. All commits (collection, composite,
 and field level) on create will have a height of '1', each subsequent local update
 will increment this by one for the new commits.

The unique CID of this commit, and the primary means through which to safely identify
 a specific commit.
`
	commitDocIDFieldDescription string = `

`
	commitCollectionIDFieldDescription string = `
The ID of the collection that this commit was committed against.

The ID of the schema version that this commit was committed against. This ID allows one
 to determine the state of the data model at the time of commit.
`
	commitFieldNameFieldDescription string = `
The name of the field that this commit was committed against. If this is a composite
 or a collection the value will be null.
`
	commitFieldIDFieldDescription string = `
The id of the field that this commit was committed against. If this is a composite field
 the value will be "C". If it is a collection level commit it will be null.

The CID of this linked commit.
`
	commitFieldsEnumDescription string = `

`
	commitsQueryDescription string = `
Returns a set of commits matching any provided criteria. If no arguments are
 provided all commits in the system will be returned.
`
	latestCommitsQueryDescription string = `
Returns a set of head commits matching any provided criteria. If no arguments are
 provided all head commits in the system will be returned. If no 'field' argument
 is provided only composite commits will be returned. This is equivalent to
 a 'commits' query with Depth: 1, and a differing 'field' default value.
`
	CountFieldDescription string = `
Returns the total number of items within the specified child sets. If multiple child
 sets are specified, the combined total of all of them will be returned as a single value.
`
	SumFieldDescription string = `

 multiple fields/sets are specified, the combined sum of all of them will be returned as
 a single value.
`
	AverageFieldDescription string = `
Returns the average of the specified field values within the specified child sets. If
 multiple fields/sets are specified, the combined average of all items within each set
 (true average, not an average of averages) will be returned as a single value.
`
	MaximumFieldDescription string = `
Returns the maximum of the specified field values within the specified child sets. If
 multiple fields/sets are specified, the combined maximum of all items within each set
 will be returned as a single value.
`
	MinimumFieldDescription string = `
Returns the minimum of the specified field values within the specified child sets. If
 multiple fields/sets are specified, the combined minimum of all items within each set
